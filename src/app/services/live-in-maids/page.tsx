                        <li><strong>Setting Boundaries</strong>: We encourage clients to define clear boundaries under which the employee will operate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Phone Usage</strong>: While we encourage workers not to be on the phone during work hours, clients are required to allow live-in staff access to their phones after their day's work is complete to contact their families.</li>
                        <li><strong>National ID Retention</strong>: As a security measure, we encourage clients to retain the National Identity Card of the live-in staff for the duration of their employment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Termination</strong>: Should you choose to terminate the live-in staff, a 14-day notice is required so we can arrange for a replacement if desired. If the termination is the client's choice, a full month's salary shall be paid to the worker.</li>
                        <li><strong>Zero-Tolerance on Violence</strong>: Under no circumstances should a client exercise violence towards an employee, nor should an employee act violently towards a client or any member of their household.</li>
